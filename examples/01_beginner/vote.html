    EXAMPLE FILE: Voting rule
    This file shows the most easy use-case for the Cacatoo library, and 
    illustrates it's core functionality with Conways Game of Life. 

    It simply load the library and other dependencies using <script>
    tags, load some CSS-stylesheets for the GUI, and than starts 
    with defining the model.
