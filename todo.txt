> Is grids[] een Object ipv Array maken (met properties "cheater", "prime") langzamer?

> Remove model as overarching class
> Spacetime plots
> Over nadenken: alleen changed pixels tekenen? :)
> Perfectmix via update_order??
>> populate grid via dict rather than 1,0.33,2,0.33 etc.
> Proper ODE state diffusion method (now it's either having edge effects due to sync, or has a random component due to async updating)
> Add option to deep copy
> Display grid after pattern-load (now it skips :()

Known issues for manual / documentation:
>> synchronous updating does NOT deep copy by default
>> asynchronous diffusing models have noise (because... async :P)
