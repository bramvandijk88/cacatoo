(rollup src/model.js -o dist/cacatoo.js -f cjs  -w)

> Spacetime plots
> Make the usage of canvases and graphs consistent (attach Graphs to the sim, and add a reference to the Graph in the GridModel-object)

> Many comments in GoL to explain what is done step by step

> Options to save PNGs:
		// change stuff below to sim.spirals.drawslide("name")
		// let canvas = sim.spirals.canvas.elem // Grab the canvas element
		// let timestamp = sim.time.toString()
		// timestamp = timestamp.padStart(5, "0")
		// canvas.toBlob(function(blob) 
		// {
		// 	saveAs(blob, "my_slide"+timestamp+".png");
		// });

> Add docstrings to all classes and methods. 
   > Simulation.js is up to date

Known issues for manual / documentation:
>> synchronous updating does NOT deep copy by default
>> asynchronous diffusing models have noise (because... async :P)
