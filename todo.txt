> Proper ODE state diffusion method (now it's either having edge effects due to sync, or has a random component due to async updating)
> Add option to deep copy
> Automate pause / run functionality button (now added manually)
> Display grid after pattern-load (now it skips :()

Known issues for manual / documentation:
>> synchronous updating does NOT deep copy by default
>> asynchronous diffusing models have noise (because... async :P)


Common mistake
>> Cannot read property '0' of undefined >> Grid is trying to display a colour that isnt defined
