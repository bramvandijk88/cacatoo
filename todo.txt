CHECK > Pattern-reading display bug (when reading, it cant display because of onload event happening at the same time as the display)
CHECK > Working out speed issues. 
> Work out better ways to control FPS / with better names than "throttle". Use prime as a testbed!

> Make sure I explain that the initial-pattern shit doesn't work without a server.... maybe I can still look into fixing this but I don't think it's worth it

> Custom neighbourhood retrieval functions
> Asynchrone updating
> Fvals / diffuse Fvals
> ODE solver for Fvals
> Pause / run functionality 
> Refactor display / grid copy functions to waste less time on copying identical states
